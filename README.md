# Viral-Detection
A 03-713 Bioinformatics Practicum project. It is focused on virus detections of a given diseased model using RNA-seq data, and some further analyses including SNP analysis etc (not complete yet).

This program needs to run on computers that have `slurm` activated (i.e. on PSC server, clustering servers).
